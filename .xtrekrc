# Key mapping
# Define your keymap here.  The format is newkey defaultkey.  For example, the
# default key for shield toggle is 's', if you want to remap shield toggle to
# 'q', you would put 'qs' in your keymap.  Shields would still be mapped to
# 's' as well as now being on 'q'.  Adding a mapping doesn't delete the old
# one.  If you want shields on 'w' as well, put 'ws' in your keymap.  If you
# had instead put 'wq', it would have mapped quit (the default action of 'q')
# onto 'w'.
#keymap: PpW Zva%d_eyftg^jmnrpPrls3tfuwvDwsye d

# Mouse button mapping
# Button map lets you map the mouse buttons.  Unfortunately, it works in a
# different way than keymap.  The format is <mousebutton> <key>.  To map
# shields onto button 1 (the left one), you would put '1s' in your keymap.
# The buttonmap works through the keymap, so if you have shields mapped to
# 'q', putting '1q' would make button 1 shields and not quit.  Buttons 4 and
# 5 are support for Microsoft Xbuttons.  If you have a wheel mouse, the up
# wheel is button 6 and the down wheel is button 7.  There is also support
# for shifted, controled, and control-shifted mouse actions, see the netrek
# help file for more details.
